- writing about 22nd april
  basically you did wake up and had a pretty-weak interview with Mandeep 
  
  then you went on to break a little,
  
  then you worked after the cook had just come, 
  
  - i did have a bunch of calls with indifolio people too
  
  
  all in all i think what i'm struggling with is that i don't have a plan. 
  
  i didn't drink a lot of water.
